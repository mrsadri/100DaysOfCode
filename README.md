# 100DaysOfCode
I am trying to learn development

Day 0:
- I have intalled needed tools, I mean VSCode and Python.
- I config my git on terminal to push my first commit using this command: ``` git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/<username>/<repo>``` after cloning the repository which I had created on Github.
