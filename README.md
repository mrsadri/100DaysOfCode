# 100 Days of Code: Conquering Python Development 

Welcome to my 100-day coding adventure, where I'll be relentlessly exploring Python's capabilities to venture into data science, automation, web development, game creation, and app development! This repository will chronicle my progress, discoveries, and the amazing projects I build along the way. 


## Day 4:  
- Now I know how to comment on a function that when someone want to use it know how to use it. This is called adding Docstring to function



## Day 3: Structuring Code for Clarity and Efficiency

**Key Discoveries:**

- **Structured Code Template:** Adopted a clear 7-section template for Python files, promoting organization and maintainability:

    ```python
    ## 1. Description
    """
    Class name: ...
    Functionality: ...
    """
    # -------------------------------------------- #

    ## 2. Libraries
    # -------------------------------------------- #

    ## 3. Functions
    # -------------------------------------------- #

    ## 4. Static Variables
    # -------------------------------------------- #

    ## 5. User Entries
    # -------------------------------------------- #

    ## 6. Main Class Action
    # -------------------------------------------- #

    ## 7. Draft, Tests, TODO List, References
    # -------------------------------------------- #
    ```

- **Multi-Cursor Productivity:** Discovered the time-saving ability to create multiple cursors by holding the `option` key and clicking on code, enabling simultaneous editing.
- **Function Mastery:** Gained proficiency in defining and utilizing custom functions.
- **Random Selection:** Unlocked the ability to randomly pick items from sets.
- **Loop Control:** Mastered both `for` and `while` loops for iterative operations.
- **Formatted Strings and Conditional Printing:** Enhanced string formatting with `f-strings` and conditional printing with `print-if`.
- **File Integration:** Learned to import and utilize functions and classes from other Python files.
- **List and Range Mastery:** Gained expertise in working with lists, including indexing with negative values, Working with Append and Extend functions. 


## Day 2: Unveiling Python's Syntax 

**Key Insights:**

- **Python's Parsing Order:** Grasped how Python evaluates code from the inside out, as demonstrated in this example:

  ```python
  print("Hello " + input("What is your " + input("What data do you want to share with me? Name or NickName?\n") + "? \n") + "!")
  ```

- **Mathematical and Conditional Operations:** Mastered their application.
- **Error Handling:** Gained fundamental knowledge.
- **Variable Types and Manipulation:** Proficient in defining variables of various types and converting them between types.
- **Built-in Functions:** Harnessed the power of functions like `random.randrange(a, b)` and `round()`.
- **Tip Calculator:** Successfully developed a practical program.

## Day 1: Setting the Stage 

**Foundational Steps:**

- **Tool Installation:** Installed VS Code and Python, the essential development tools.
- **Git Configuration:** Configured Git on the terminal to enable pushing commits, using the following command:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/<username>/<repo>
  ```
  
- **First Image Insertion:** Mastered embedding images within the README.md file.
- **Initial Code Execution:** Ran my first Python code, marking a momentous beginning!

- **String Quotation Mastery:** Gained a thorough understanding of the differences between single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes.
- **User Input Handling:** Learned to capture user input and assign it to variables.
- **Commenting Code:** Discovered how to transform lines of code into non-executable comments.
- **Git Push to Main Branch:** Successfully pushed code to the main branch using:

  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```

- **Branch Awareness:** Recognized the distinction between pushing to `main` and `master` branches and their implications for merge requests.

Stay tuned as my Python journey unfolds, revealing exciting projects and knowledge milestones! ✨
