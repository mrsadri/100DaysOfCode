# My Path to Learning Python

I embarked on my Python learning journey through the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course by Angelina Yu on the Udemy website. My progress path can be viewed [here](/Course%20-%20100%20Days%20of%20Code%20day-by-day/).

While mastering the syntax and basics of Python, I felt the need to delve deeper into object-oriented programming. This led me to the book "Python 3 Object-oriented Programming" authored by Dusty Phillip. My progress path for this book is available [here](/Book%20-%20Python3%20Object-oriented%20Programming%20by%20Dusty%20Phillip).

Subsequently, my wife, Homa Rahim, informed me about an online data analysis boot camp offered by Rahnema College. To meet the prerequisites for this boot camp, including Python, database skills, and knowledge of statistics and probability, I sought out a practical book. I chose "Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics in Python" by Allen B. Downey, published by O'Reilly Media. I've included this book in my learning path, and you can track my progress [here](/Book%20-%20Think%20Bayes_%20Bayesian%20Statistics%20in%20Python-O'Reilly%20Media%20-%20Allen%20B.%20Downey/).

Feel free to explore my journey and resources as I continue to enhance my Python skills and delve into the realms of data analysis.
