# 100 Days of Code: Conquering Python Development 

Welcome to my 100-day coding adventure, where I'll be relentlessly exploring Python's capabilities to venture into data science, automation, web development, game creation, and app development! This repository will chronicle my progress, discoveries, and the amazing projects I build along the way. 

## Day 1: Unveiling Python's Inner Workings 

**Key Insights:**

- **Python's Parsing Order:** Grasped how Python evaluates code from the inside out, as demonstrated in this example:

  ```python
  print("Hello " + input("What is your " + input("What data do you want to share with me? Name or NickName?\n") + "? \n") + "!")
  ```

- **Mathematical and Conditional Operations:** Mastered their application.
- **Error Handling:** Gained fundamental knowledge.
- **Variable Types and Manipulation:** Proficient in defining variables of various types and converting them between types.
- **Built-in Functions:** Harnessed the power of functions like `random.randrange(a, b)` and `round()`.
- **Tip Calculator:** Successfully developed a practical program.

## Day 0: Setting the Stage 

**Foundational Steps:**

- **Tool Installation:** Installed VS Code and Python, the essential development tools.
- **Git Configuration:** Configured Git on the terminal to enable pushing commits, using the following command:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin https://<token>@[github.com/](https://github.com/)<username>/<repo>
  ```
  

- **First Image Insertion:** Mastered embedding images within the README.md file.
- **Initial Code Execution:** Ran my first Python code, marking a momentous beginning!

- **String Quotation Mastery:** Gained a thorough understanding of the differences between single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes.
- **User Input Handling:** Learned to capture user input and assign it to variables.
- **Commenting Code:** Discovered how to transform lines of code into non-executable comments.
- **Git Push to Main Branch:** Successfully pushed code to the main branch using:

  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```

- **Branch Awareness:** Recognized the distinction between pushing to `main` and `master` branches and their implications for merge requests.
